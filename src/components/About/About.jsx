                        The entire amount of greenhouse gasesâ€”including carbon dioxide and
                        methaneâ€”that are produced as a result of human actions is known as a carbon footprint.

                        One of the highest rates in the world, the average carbon footprint of a person in the
                        United States is 16 tonnes. The average carbon footprint throughout the globe is closer
                        to 4 tonnes. By 2050, the average worldwide carbon footprint per year must fall to under
                        2 tonnes in order to have the best chance of preventing an increase in global temperatures of 2Â°C.

                        Individual carbon footprint reduction from 16 tonnes to 2 tonnes takes time! We may start to
                        have a significant impact by making minor adjustments to our behaviour, such as eating less meat,
                        booking fewer connecting flights, and line-drying our clothing.
